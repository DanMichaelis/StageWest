                    <h2>Monthly Playwriting Workshops</h2>
                    <p>Do you have a script you have been working on? Have you always wanted to get into playwriting but
                        not sure where to start? Having actors read your work aloud, also called workshopping, is an
                        essential part of the development process. Are you an actor looking to sharpen your skill at
                        developing characters by lending your talents to help playwrights improve their work?</p>
                    <p>Join us for a once monthly playwriter&#39;s workshop. Each month we will select the work of one
                        or more playwrights and do cold readings followed by script discussions.</p>
                    <p>The goal of each meeting is to utilize the vast talents of local actors to bring life to the work
                        of local playwrights.</p>
                    <p>Everyone is encouraged to attend no matter their experience level. Scripts must be selected in
                        advance of each meeting in order to ensure that there are enough actors to read your script. You
                        do not need to have a complete play, just a scene will be fine. Find more information on the
                        theater&#39;s Facebook page. Email scripts and questions to <a
                            href="mailto:asarabia@live.com"></a>asarabia@live.com.</p>
                    <p>The playwriters workshop generally meets the first Saturday of each month in the Stage West
                        conference room at 1pm. The workshop will be held on the following dates:</p>
                    <p>March 2, 2024</p>
                    <p>April 6, 2024</p>
                    <p>May 4, 2024</p>

                        2024 Summer Youth Theatre Camps</h2>
                    <p>Budding actors will find these seven-hour daily sessions brimming with activities that explore
                        the basics and finer points of theatre. Beginning campers will learn everything from stage
                        positions to stage combat while Advanced campers will fine-tune their skills in character
                        development.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of each camp are showcase performances where each student&#39;s talent is
                        allowed to shine.
                        Stage West&#39;s Summer Theatre Camps are more than just about acting; they are an excellent
                        opportunity for young people to find the joy of theatrical expression and the inclusive and fun
