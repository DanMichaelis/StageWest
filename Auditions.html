                    <p style="margin-top: 0%;">With a score by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Mary Poppins), Honk! JR.
                        is a heartwarming
                        celebration of being different that is sure to delight audiences of all ages with its sparkling
                        wit, unique charm and memorable score. Witty and hilarious, but also deeply moving, Honk! JR.
                        treats audiences to equal amounts of laughter and tears.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ugly looks quite a bit different from his darling duckling brothers and sisters. The other
                        animals on the farm are quick to notice and point this out, despite his motherâ€™s protective
                        flapping. Feeling rather foul about himself, the little fowl finds himself on an adventure of
                        self-discovery, all the while unknowingly outwitting a very hungry Cat. Along the way, Ugly
                        meets a whole flock of unique characters and finds out being different is not a bad thing to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>Auditions will consist of vocal auditions and cold readings from the script. On the day of
                        auditions, <b>please wear comfortable clothing and bring a prepared song to sing (16
                            measures)</b> of
                        your choice. A blue tooth speaker will be available to pair to if you require acccompaniment
                        from your own device. No other accompaniment is avaialable at auditions.</p>

                                wise swan, filled with self-esteem. He is the heart and soul of the show. He must be a

                                away from the barnyard by the Cat, Ida is determined to find him. Ida and Ugly's
                                relationship is a key ingredient of the show. She is the one who teaches him that it is
                                OK to be different. Ida sings several solos, and therefore she should have a strong

                                Ugly's friend so he can eat him. The actor playing this role should bring a sense of fun

                                comic timing. He sings a few songs, but his character allows for many of the lyrics to
                                be "talk-sung." Improv skills are a plus.</td>

                                say it to anyone, including his wife. He should have good comic timing and a strong
                                singing voice. Drake opens the show singing "A Poultry Tale."</td>

                                gossip. To the little ducklings, she is the typical annoying and overly affectionate
